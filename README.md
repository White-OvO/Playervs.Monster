 Introduction
In this lab, you’ll build a small, text-based duel where your choices matter and the program reacts in a predictable rhythm. Each turn, the player chooses between a quick stab or a heavier slash, and the monster responds in a perfect 1-for-1 rotation—sometimes blocking, sometimes launching a fireball. Your program will read the player’s choice, validate it, apply effects, and update health until one side drops to zero.

The purpose is to practice clean selection and input handling inside a simple game loop. By the end, you’ll be comfortable validating choices, branching behavior (player action vs. monster response), tracking state over time (health), and detecting end-conditions to announce a clear winner. These are the same patterns you’ll reuse in larger programs—menu-driven tools, simulations, and command handlers—where reliable input checks and well-structured decisions keep your code correct and easy to debug.
